# Public Assets Folder

This folder contains static assets that are served directly from the root URL.

Files in this folder can be referenced in your code like:
- `/background.png` → serves `public/background.png`
- `/logo.svg` → serves `public/logo.svg`

## Usage
Place your background image here and reference it in CSS or components.
